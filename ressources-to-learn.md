# How to train yourself to train neural networks

Here is a compilation of blog posts and papers that help quickly start working on neural networks for images. It is not meant to be comprehensive, it rathers provides a short path towards being quickly operational and starting to work on echOpen.



### General introduction to Machine Learning

By increasing order of time demand

* [Nando de Freitas's excellent course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6Wd9FR--EfW8dtjAuPoTuPcqmOV53Fu)
* [Hugo Larochelle's course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Xpj9I5qXYEcOhn7TqghAJ6NAPrNmUBH): longer but now a reference in the field

### Image processing & Convolutional Networks
