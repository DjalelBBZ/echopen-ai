# Request for Research

As an Open Research/Open source project, we welcome every contribution, from simple suggestions to concrete implementations. Interestingly, echOpen raises many interesting questions on different topics related to AI, such as

* Denoising images and improving the image quality for physicians \(electronic noise and speckle reduction for instance\)
* Organ recognition
* Anomaly and pathology detection
* Model adaptation for particular particular patients
* Explainability of the models
* Compression of the models
* Real-time prediction on a mobile device
* Better visualization of ultra-sound imaging via style transfer
* Generation a realistic rendering out of ultra-sound images
* Interactive AI-aided navigation

As well as non technical questions, as for

* Data security
* Data repatriation

Following the model of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/requests-for-research/) and [AI-ON](http://ai-on.org/), we have specified a number of subjects that are only waiting to be tackled. Some of them pertain to engineering, other are still in the domain of research. We are currently working actively on two of them,
 
# Noise Reduction {#noise_reduction}

Image improvement (TODO).

# Mobile Deployment {#mobile_deployment}

* Model compression
* Precision reduction
