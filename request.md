# Request for Research

As an Open Research/Open source project, we welcome every contribution, from simple suggestions to concrete implementations. Interestingly, echOpen raises many interesting questions on different topics related to AI, 

* Denoising images and improving the image quality for physicians \(electronic and speckle\)
* Organ recognition 
* Anomaly detection
* Model adaptation for particular cases \(fat subjects etc.\)
* Explainability of the models
* Compression of the models
* Real-time prediction on a mobile device
* Better visualization of ultra-sound imaging via style transfer
* Generation a realistic rendering out of ultra-sound images
* Interactive AI-aided navigation

Following the model of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/requests-for-research/) and [AI-ON](http://ai-on.org/), we have specified a number of subjects that are only waiting to be tackled. Some of them pertain to engineering, other are still in the domain of research.

## Non-ML questions

* Data security
* Data repatriation

# Noise Reduction {#noise_reduction}

Image improvement

TODO

# Mobile Deployment {#mobile_deployment}

* Model compression
* Precision reduction
