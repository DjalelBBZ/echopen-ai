# Request for Research

As an Open Research/Open source project, we welcome every contribution, from simple suggestions to concrete implementations. Following the model of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/requests-for-research/) and [AI-ON](http://ai-on.org/), we have specified a number of subjects that are only waiting to be tackled. Some of them pertain to engineering, other are still in the domain of research.

Interestingly, echOpen raises many questions on different topics related to AI

* Explainability of the models
* Compression of the models
* Real-time prediction on a mobile device
* Organ recognition 
* Anomaly detection
* Model adaptation for particular cases \(fat subjects etc.\)
* Denoising images and improving the image quality for physicians \(electronic and speckle\)
* Generate a realistic rendering of the images so to make the result intelligible
  by non-practitioners
* Ultrasound Aided Navigation

## Non-ML questions

* Data security
* Data repatriation

# Noise Reduction {#noise_reduction}

Image improvement

TODO

# Mobile Deployment {#mobile_deployment}

* Model compression
* Precision reduction
