# How to contribute

There are several ways to contribute.

* **General discussion**: if you feel inspired by the project, want to suggest a new use-case or a new approach to follow, your contributions are always welcome.
* **Documentation & literature**: we try to list, for every sub-project, the right references and ressources. If you have something to add, simply send a pull request. \(TODO: point to the echopen doc repo\)
* **Implement & share**: Work on one of the [Requests for Research](request.md), summarize what you did in a Jupyter notebook or simply document your code, and then send a pull request so we add your work to the knowledge base, compare it to what is already done and deploy it.

## Pick one of the [Requests for Research](/request.md)

* Choose a problem to work on
* Download the data
* Optionally read the literature and/or enrich it with new pertinent papers
* Preferably, join us on [Slack](https://echopen.slack.com) to discuss your work \(send us a mail to get an account\)
* Create a Jupyter notebook 
* Fill it with all the details about your approach and the necessary references
* If pertinent, report the performance of your approach if the request in question is associated with a leaderboard.
* Send a Pull Request
