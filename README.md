# AI @ echOpen

This document aims at motivating the application of Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) algorithm to the _echOpen_ project. It is also meant to be a starting kit for whomever wants to contribute to the project, or simply wants to know more about machine learning algorithms applied to ultra-sound imaging in a real-time embedded environment.

## The project

Despite the technological advances a large part of world enjoys today, it remains that two third of the world population have no access whatsoever to any medical diagnosis device \[ref\]. This situation is mainly due to the exorbitant price of these medical tools and the lack of enough trained medical practitioners in some regions. We believe that open source, collective intelligence and artificial intelligence, combined together, could solve this aberrant situation and literally save millions of lives.

Data

The short-term objective is to endow echOpen with an _AI-aided diagnosis_ system, capable of detecting organs, anomalies and in general, improving the image quality and the user experience of the medical practitioner. The long-term objectif is to extend its usability to non-practitioners, make deployable with little or no training, thus providing an immediate dia
