# AI @ echOpen

This document aims at motivating the application of **Artificial Intelligence** \(AI\) algorithms to the _echOpen_ project. It is also meant to be a starting kit for whomever wants to contribute to the project, or simply wants to know more about **machine learning** algorithms applied to **ultra-sound** imaging in a **real-time embedded** environment.

## The project

Despite the technological advances a large part of world enjoys today, it remains that two third of the world population have no access whatsoever to a medical diagnosis device \[ref\]. This situation is mainly due to the exorbitant price of these medical tools as well as the lack of a proper number of trained medical practitioners in some regions. We believe that open source, collective intelligence and artificial intelligence, combined together, could change this aberrant situation and literally save millions of lives.

_echOpen_ is an open-source ultrasound probe connected to an android smartphone. Here, we are interested in echOpen as a platform for implementing novel AI applications for medical diagnosis. In fact, having 

Network, embedded

Data

The short-term objective is to endow echOpen with an _AI-aided diagnosis_ system, capable of detecting organs, anomalies and in general, improving the image quality and the user experience of the medical practitioner. The long-term objectif is to extend its usability to non-practitioners, make deployable with little or no training.
